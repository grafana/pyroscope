### This is a pre-release demo project for internal use only

The docker compose consists of:
 - Ride share demo application
 - Tempo
 - Pyroscope
 - Grafana

`rideshare` applications generate traces and profiling data that should be available in Grafana.
Pyroscope and Tempo datasources are provisioned automatically.

### Build and run

The project can be run locally with the following commands:

```shell
docker-compose up --build
```

that have a linked profile:

By default, only the root span gets labeled (the first span created locally): such spans are marked with the _link_ icon
and have `pyroscope.profile.id` attribute set to the corresponding span ID.
Please note that presence of the attribute does not necessarily
indicate that the span has a profile: stack trace samples might not be collected, if the utilized CPU time is
less than the sample interval (10ms).

### Instrumentation

 - `rideshare` demo application instrumented with OpenTelemetry and [Pyroscope SDK](https://github.com/grafana/otel-profiling-go)
 - `pyroscope` itself is instrumented with `opentracing-go` SDK and [`spanprofiler`](../../../pkg/util/spanprofiler) for profiling integration.

### Grafana Tempo configuration

In order to correlate trace spans with profiling data, Tempo datasource should be configured:
 - Data source of the profiling data.
 - Tags to use in the query.
 - Profile type: as of now, only CPU time profile is fully supported.
 - Query override.

While tags are optional, configuring them is highly recommended for optimizing query performance.
In our example, we configured the `host.name` tag for use in Pyroscope queries as the `hostname` label.
This configuration restricts the data set for lookup to a specific host, ensuring that queries remain
consistently fast. Note that the tags you configure must be present in the spans attributes or resources
for a trace to profiles span link to appear.

Please refer to our [documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/next/datasources/tempo/configure-tempo-data-source/#trace-to-profiles) for more details.
