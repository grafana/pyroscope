# Pyroscope pull with static targets

This example demonstrates how Pyroscope can be used to scrape pprof profiles from remote targets discovered via file-based service discovery mechanism.

When using Pyroscope' file-based service discovery mechanism, the Prometheus instance will listen for changes to the file and automatically update the scrape target list, without requiring an instance restart.

### 1. Run Pyroscope server and demo applications in docker containers

```shell
docker-compose up -d
```

As a sample application we use slightly modified Jaeger [Hot R.O.D.](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/tree/master/examples/hotrod) demo â€“
the only difference is that we enabled built-in Go `pprof` HTTP endpoints. You can find the modified code in the [hotrod-goland](https://github.com/pyroscope-io/hotrod-golang) repository.

Note that we apply configuration defined in `server.yml`:

<details>
    <summary>server.yml</summary>

```yaml
---
log-level: debug
scrape-configs:
  - job-name: testing
    enabled-profiles: [cpu, mem, goroutines, mutex, block]
    file-sd-configs:
      - refresh-interval: 10s
        files:
          - '/targets.json'
```

</details>

The file contains a list of remote target the Pyroscope server will pull profiling data from:

<details>
    <summary>targets.json</summary>

```json
[
  {
    "application": "hotrod",
    "spy-name": "gospy",
    "labels": {
      "env": "dev"
    },
    "targets": [
      "hotrod:6060"
    ]
  },
  {
    "application": "my-app",
    "spy-name": "gospy",
    "labels": {
      "env": "dev"
    },
    "targets": [
      "app:6060"
    ]
  }
]
```

</details>

### 2. Observe profiling data

Profiling is more fun when the application does some work. Let's order some rides [in our Hot R.O.D. app](http://localhost:8080).

Now that everything is set up, you can browse profiling data via [Pyroscope UI](http://localhost:4040).
