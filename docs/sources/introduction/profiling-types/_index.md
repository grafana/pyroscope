# Profiling types and their uses

In Grafana Pyroscope, various profiling types allow for an in-depth analysis of different aspects of your application.

## Profiling types

Profiling types refer to different dimensions of application performance analysis, focusing on specific aspects like CPU usage, memory allocation, or thread synchronization.
