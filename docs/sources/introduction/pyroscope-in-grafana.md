Readers learn about features through concepts. Concepts do not include step-by-step procedures or reference material but often link to those materials.

Refer to the [Concept topic documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/writers-toolkit/writing-guide/topic-types/concept/) for guidelines on writing a concept topic.
