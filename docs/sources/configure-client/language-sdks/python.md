# Python

## How to add Python profiling to your application

Install the `pyroscope-io` pip package:

```bash
pip install pyroscope-io
```

## Pyroscope Python pip package configuration

Add the following code to your application. This code will initialize the Pyroscope profiler and start profiling:

```python
import pyroscope

pyroscope.configure(
  application_name = "my.python.app", # replace this with some name for your application
  server_address   = "http://my-pyroscope-server:4040", # replace this with the address of your Pyroscope server
)
```

Optionally, you can configure several additional parameters:

```python
import pyroscope

pyroscope.configure(
    application_name    = "my.python.app", # replace this with some name for your application
    server_address      = "http://my-pyroscope-server:4040", # replace this with the address of your Pyroscope server
    sample_rate         = 100, # default is 100
    detect_subprocesses = False, # detect subprocesses started by the main process; default is False
    oncpu               = True, # report cpu time only; default is True
    gil_only            = True, # only include traces for threads that are holding on to the Global Interpreter Lock; default is True
    log_level           = "info", # default is info, possible values: trace, debug, info, warn, error and critical
    tags                = {
        "region": '{os.getenv("REGION")}',
    }
)
```

## How to add profiling labels to Python applications

You can add tags to certain parts of your code:

```python
# You can use a wrapper:
with pyroscope.tag_wrapper({ "controller": "slow_controller_i_want_to_profile" }):
    slow_code()
```

## Sending data to Pyroscope OSS or Grafana Cloud Profiles with Python SDK


```python
import pyroscope

pyroscope.configure(
    application_name = "example.python.app",
    server_address = "<URL>",
    basic_auth_username = '<User>',
    basic_auth_password = '<Password>',
    # Optional Pyroscope tenant ID (only needed if using multi-tenancy). Not needed for Grafana Cloud.
    # tenant_id = "<TenantID>",
)
```

To configure the Python SDK to send data to Pyroscope, replace the `<URL>` placeholder with the appropriate server URL. This could be the Grafana Cloud URL or your own custom Pyroscope server URL.

If you need to send data to Grafana Cloud, you'll have to configure HTTP Basic authentication. Replace `<User>` with your Grafana Cloud stack user and `<Password>` with your Grafana Cloud API key.

If your Pyroscope server has multi-tenancy enabled, you'll need to configure a tenant ID. Replace `<TenantID>` with your Pyroscope tenant ID.
