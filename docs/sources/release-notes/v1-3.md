# Version 1.3 release notes

We are excited to present Grafana Pyroscope 1.3.

This release focuses on improving stability and interoperability to make Pyroscope more reliable and easier to use.

Several major improvements were made to the compaction process:

* Improved performance and storage efficiency of the symbol compaction process.
* Optimized data processing by adding support for time-based down-sampling during the compaction process.
* Added tracing integration to compaction for better observability.
* Improved system stability during compaction shutdown
* Added a `profilecli compact` command

Notable changes are listed below. For more details, check out the **Full 1.3.0 Changelog**: https://github.com/grafana/pyroscope/compare/v1.2.1...v1.3.0

## Features and enhancements

Features and enhancements for version 1.3 include:

* Enhanced symbol compaction process: Improved performance and storage efficiency with the new symbol compaction process ([#2864](https://github.com/grafana/pyroscope/pull/2864)).
* Introduced function selector in pprof query: More precise profiling with the addition of a function selector ([#2878](https://github.com/grafana/pyroscope/pull/2878)).
* Support for time-based downsampling during compaction: Optimized data processing with time-based strategies ([#2880](https://github.com/grafana/pyroscope/pull/2880)).
* Added tracing integrations to compaction: Better observability in the compaction process ([#2876](https://github.com/grafana/pyroscope/pull/2876)).
* Added language mapping for Grafana Agent in Java: Expanded profiling capabilities ([#2866](https://github.com/grafana/pyroscope/pull/2866)).
