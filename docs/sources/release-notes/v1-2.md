# Version 1.2 release notes

We are excited to present this release of Grafana Pyroscope packed with 150 commits.

In this release, we've introduced significant enhancements to our microservice mode, aiming to boost performance and streamline operations. The **compactor** component has been added to optimize block management, improving query speed and reducing replication factor overhead.

Our physical planning has undergone optimization, ensuring that data deduplication occurs only when necessary. Additionally, we've initiated tracing integrations, allowing for the inclusion of span ids in profiling samples and enabling flamegraph filtering.

For users leveraging Function as a Service (FaaS) environments, we've enhanced profiling data ingestion by automatically aggregating profiles. This not only reduces the number of profiles but also contributes to improved overall efficiency.

We've invested substantial effort in optimizing the read path and refining query performance, delivering a smoother user experience.
