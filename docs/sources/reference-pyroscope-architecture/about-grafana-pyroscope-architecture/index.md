# About the Pyroscope architecture

Pyroscope has a microservices-based architecture.
The system has multiple horizontally scalable microservices that can run separately and in parallel.
Pyroscope microservices are called components.

Pyroscope's design compiles the code for all components into a single binary.
The `-target` parameter controls which component(s) that single binary will behave as. For those looking for a simple way to get started, Pyroscope can also be run in [monolithic mode]({{< relref "../deployment-modes/index.md#monolithic-mode" >}}), with all components running simultaneously in one process.
For more information, refer to [Deployment modes]({{< relref "../deployment-modes/index.md" >}}).

## Pyroscope components

Most components are stateless and do not require any data persisted between process restarts. Some components are stateful and rely on non-volatile storage to prevent data loss between process restarts. For details about each component, see its page in [Components]({{< relref "../components/_index.md" >}}).

Ingesters receive incoming profiles from the distributors.
Each push request belongs to a tenant, and the ingester appends the received profiles to the specific per-tenant Pyroscope database that is stored on the local disk.

The per-tenant Pyroscope database is lazily created in each ingester as soon as the first profiles are received for that tenant.

The in-memory profiles are periodically flushed to disk and new block is created.

For more information, refer to [Ingester]({{< relref "../components/ingester.md" >}}).

#### Series sharding and replication

By default, each profile series is replicated to three ingesters, and each ingester writes its own block to the long-term storage.

Queries coming into Pyroscope arrive at [query-frontend]({{< relref "../components/query-frontend" >}}) component which is responsible for accelerating queries and dispatching them to the [query-scheduler]({{< relref "../components/query-scheduler" >}}).

The [query-scheduler]({{< relref "../components/query-scheduler" >}}) maintains a queue of queries and ensures that each tenant's queries are fairly executed.

The [querier]({{< relref "../components/querier" >}}) act as workers, pulling queries from the queue in the query-scheduler. The queriers connect to the ingesters to fetch all the data needed to execute a query. For more information about how the query is executed, refer to [querier]({{< relref "../components/querier.md" >}}).

## Long-term storage

The Pyroscope storage format is described in detail in on the [block format page]({{< relref "..//block-format/" >}}).
The Pyroscope storage format stores each tenant's profiles into their own on-disk block. Each on-disk block directory contains an index file, a file containing metadata, and the Parquet tables.

Pyroscope requires any of the following object stores for the block files:

- [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3)
- [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/)
- [Microsoft Azure Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/)
- [OpenStack Swift](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Swift)
- Local Filesystem (single node only)

For more information, refer to [configure object storage]({{< relref "../../configure-server/configure-object-storage-backend.md" >}}) and [configure disk storage]({{< relref "../../configure-server/configure-disk-storage.md" >}}).
