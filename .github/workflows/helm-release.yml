# NOTE: We need to store GH_RELEASES_APP_ID and GH_RELEASES_APP_PRIVATE_KEY as repository secrets
# (even though we already store them in Vault) due to limitations in how secrets can be
# accessed and passed between different parts of a GitHub Actions workflow.
#
# The grafana/helm-charts/.github/workflows/update-helm-repo.yaml is a reusable workflow,
# not a composite action. This means we can't run steps to retrieve secrets from Vault
# before calling this workflow within the same job.
#
# While we have access to the grafana/shared-workflows/actions/get-vault-secrets@main action,
# environment variables set by this action in one job are not accessible in other jobs or
# in reusable workflows called from this workflow.
